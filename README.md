# squareerrorfunction
This is an analysis and explaination of the Square Error Function, AKA Cost Function, with Python code.
I will also be posting a video link once I complete the video.  If you have had trouble understanding 
what this function is all about,  you have come to the right place.  I am a layman, not a guru on this
subject, but that means I explain it on a level that is approachable for most people, and if you study
it, look over the code, comments, maybe even use the debugger to see how the code is behaving, you will
come out with a very solid grasp of what the Square Error Function is all about.
