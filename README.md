# squareerrorfunction
This is an analysis and explaination of the Square Error Function, AKA Cost Function, with Python code.
If you have had trouble understanding what this function is all about,  you have come to the right place.  
I am a layman, not a guru on this subject, but that means I explain it on a level that is approachable 
for most people, and if you study it, look over the code, comments, maybe even use the debugger to see 
how the code is behaving, you will come out with a very solid grasp of what the Square Error Function is 
all about.


Reader take note:  This code was written from within Pycharm, not on the command line.  I am using Pycharm
because it is much easier to view comments, and, the coding hints make it far faster and easier to use than
the command line.
